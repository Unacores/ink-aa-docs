## Understanding FIU Workflows  

As an FIU, your integration revolves around managing consent and data flows. Below are the key steps to ensure a smooth process:  

### üö¶ Consent Flow  

#### 1. **Requesting Consent**  
- Initiate the consent process via the `/Consent` API.  
- Ink AA notifies the customer through app notifications or SMS.  
- The customer reviews and approves/rejects the request in the Ink app (mobile or web).  

#### 2. **Notifying FIU of Consent Status**  
- Once a customer makes their decision, Ink AA informs the FIU using the `/Consent/Notification` API.  
- FIUs can then retrieve consent details via the `/Consent/{id}` endpoint to update their systems.

### üìä Data Flow  

#### 1. **Initiating a Data Request**  
- Upon consent approval, request financial data via the `/FI/request` API.  
- The AA server generates a unique session ID and forwards the request to relevant FIPs as per the consent details.

#### 2. **Receiving Data**  
- Wait for the "Data Ready" notification from Ink AA, signaling data availability.  
- Retrieve the data securely from the AA server.

## Understanding AA Workflows and Customer Interaction  

Ink AA empowers customers to securely share their financial data. The process is intuitive and includes:  

### üõ†Ô∏è **Step 1: Customer Registration with AA**  
- Customers register using the Ink mobile app or web platform.  
- Upon registration, they receive a unique AA handle, such as:  
  - `yourname@ink`  
  - `9999999999@ink` (mobile-based handle).  

This handle is shared with FIUs for initiating consent requests, similar to a UPI handle for payments.  

---

### üîó **Step 2: Linking Financial Accounts**  
- Customers link their financial accounts by authenticating with their Financial Institution using an OTP.  
- This step ensures all linked accounts are ready for data sharing.  

---

### üîê **Step 3: Secure Sharing of Financial Information**  
- Customers approve or reject consent requests directly from the Ink app.  
- Approved consents enable FIUs to securely access specified financial data via Ink AA.
